## Windows Sandbox
Technically [Windows Sandbox](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview "Windows Sandbox Documentation") is a lightweight virtual machine created on demand which a user can safely run applications in isolation. This virtual machine is using the same OS image as in the host machine. Software installed inside the Windows Sandbox environment remains "sandboxed" and runs separately from the base machine.

Windows sandbox should be enabled before first use. [Check how here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview#installation "Windows Sandbox Installation")

## ScoopBox
[ScoopBox](https://github.com/hasan-hasanov/ScoopBox) is a C# library that helps you launch the Windows Sandbox with preinstalled applications using package managers Scoop and Chocolate.

_You can find more information about Windows Sandbox and ScoopBox in my [blog](https://hasan-hasanov.com/2020/11/25/scoopbox/)._
